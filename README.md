## ASS font collector. ##

**You need Python 3.x to run this script.**

**Important**
- Try rebuild cache before submitting any issues.
- All fonts included in tests\files folders are purely for testing. Do not use it as you please since it might be agains its licenses.
- We are **not** responsible for your broken fansubs. This script is not ideal, might contain bugs and it is not completely safe to use (what is?).

### About ###
This is a Python program for automatic collecting of fonts used in ass script. It basically works like FontCollector in [Aegisub][aegi] but provides a few additional [features][features].

Despite being written in Python it's still pretty fast, mostly thanks to [caching][caching]. Some code still needs optimizing, but we're working on it.

You can find more information in project [wiki][wiki].

It works only on Python 3.x (3.2 and 3.3 at least), Windows, Linux and sometimes OS X (support is not guaranteed. Feel free to donate me a Macbook if you want it implemented)

### Contacts ###
Feel free to submit any bugs or feature requests to `tp7` or `tonik` on `irc.rizon.net`, but preffered way is opening an issue here.
