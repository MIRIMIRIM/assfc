### About ###
This is a Python program for automatic collecting of fonts used in ass script. It basically works like FontCollector in [Aegisub][aegi] but provides a few additional [features][features].

Despite being written in Python it's still pretty fast, mostly thanks to [caching][caching]. Some code still needs optimizing, but we're working on it.

You can find more information in project [wiki][wiki].

### Contacts ###
Feel free to submit any bugs or feature requests to `tp7` or `tonik` on `irc.rizon.net`, but preffered way is opening an issue here.
